# Hi üëã, I'm TawalMcüòé
### A passionate software developer from Benin (üáßüáØ). I'm power and process engineer specialized in embedded system ingeneering (IoT). As I work in embedded system engineering I work with differents technologies from **C++** (program **mCU**) to **Kotlin** (IoT Android App) by **React** (IoT web platform).
*Here are some personal projects that I built*

## Web apps üåê
### Technologies used
- HTML5/CSS3
- JavaScript
- React/NextJS ‚öõÔ∏è

### Apps developed
1. Real time guessing game: React + Grommet + Styled component üíÖ + TypeScript + React router + Nodejs + Express + Socket + Heroku

I built a multiplayer (02 players) real time guessing game where players guess the odd emojis. Just a pseudo and a token are need to start the game.
### *Source code*: [GuessingGame](https://github.com/TawalMc/GuessingGame)

### *Demo app*: [Guessing game on heroku](https://guessing-game-mc.herokuapp.com/)
This web app was based on React/Typescript. And I use Socket on client and server to execute in real time all actions and allow players to views the state of "emoji boxes". At I display the scores of each players. There are some bugs to correct like the *restart* options.

2. Accredhospi-Benin: React + Material UI
It is a private that I built for a client from Benin. It allow nurses to qualify by a percentage an hospital based some criteria defines by Benin norms for health. It is a great interactive web app where at the end you can export to excell the informations to reuse them.

### *Demo ap*: [Accredhospi](https://accredhospi.netlify.app/)

3. Captain react: React + Material UI ‚ùÑÔ∏è + React router + NodeJS + Express

It is a simple web app which display to users some informations about superheroes like their: poster, name, real name,birth name, power, ... And the user needs just to enter a superhero name or some letter contained in his name.
### *Source code*: [Captain react](https://github.com/TawalMc/captainreact)

### *Demo app*: [Captain react on Heroku](https://captainreact.herokuapp.com/)
This web app was based on React/MUI and express and superhero API. I deploy it on heroku and serve the build file of the client side (react public) from express/nodejs to render in the same adress. And I communicate to the superhero API server via my server side built in express/nodejs to avoid CORS issues.

4. Departements of Benin: React + React router

It is web game app where users are asked to choose the right answer which match the questions about City/Town and Department of Benin.
### *Source code*: [departements_Benin](https://github.com/TawalMc/departements_Benin)

I used here react only with react router.

## About me ü§ô
I am young developer. I will be graduate in power and process engineering in few months(ü§£). I love to write code, build app and deploy it and see how it works and how firends and users talk about it. I love to interact with my world and work on real projects. Football, game, stories, superheroes and actions movie are the way that I use to distract myself if I have some free times. I love to experiment new things If they are useful. One of my dreams is to be part of an open source project or take a talk during a React Conf or Qt world summit...
